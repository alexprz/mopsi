# MOPSI : Model, Program, Simulate
**Why is this project on GitHub ?**

This project has been made as part of our lessons at ENPC school. 
It is not made to be reused as it does not bring anything particular to the community (it is not a package).
Why is it on GitHub then ?
There may be 2 reasons for this project to be hosted on GitHub:
- To collaborate with my project partner (if any).
- To be able to show some projects and code to recruiters.

With this in mind, here are the files to look at.

**Where to look at ?**

```algo.py```  
Implement the simulated annealing algorithm with different decay process.
This algo is general and does not depend on the way the data is stored since
it only uses the ```graph.py``` interface.

```graph.py```  
Implement the data structure of the given problem. To adapt this project to
another problem, only this file should be deeply edited.

Other  
The other files are just a parser to read the data and write the solution and
some config.
